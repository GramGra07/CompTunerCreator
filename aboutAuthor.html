About the Author
</h1>
<p>
I'm Graden from FTC Team 10448 
<br><br>
I have been in FTC for a total of three years now, all years as lead programmer and team coach.
<br><br>
I hope to share my knowledge and learning throughout the FTC community. As well as using my skills to help the community by developing some apps for my church as well as the FTC community.
<br><br>
I am a junior in High School and play soccer.
<br><br>
I have made the Code Training Module as a side project throughout the last year.
